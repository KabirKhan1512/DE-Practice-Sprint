# 🧠 Data Engineering Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my **Data Engineering Mastery Repository** — a personal, structured roadmap that documents my journey from practitioner to professional-level Data Engineer.  
This repo combines **hands-on projects**, **learning plans**, and **theoretical foundations** across modern data engineering tools and concepts.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository is designed to:
- Build **production-ready skills** in Airflow, SQL, Python, and AWS.
- Strengthen **data engineering theory** beyond tools and syntax.
- Serve as a **portfolio** of scripts, notes, and projects that reflect real-world data engineering work.

## ⚙️ 1. Apache Airflow (6-Week Plan)

**Goal:** Master workflow orchestration and automation using Airflow in Docker and AWS.

### Key Topics:
- DAG design and scheduling fundamentals  
- Sensors, Hooks, XComs, and custom operators  
- Airflow architecture (scheduler, executor, metadata DB)  
- Connections and secrets management  
- Integrating with AWS S3 and Snowflake  
- CI/CD and DAG deployment on Amazon MWAA

### Outcome:
By the end, you can design and deploy **production-grade DAGs** for batch or streaming data pipelines, integrated with cloud services.

---

## 🐍 2. Python for Data Engineering (6-Week Plan)

**Goal:** Use Python not as a language, but as a **data pipeline toolkit**.

### Key Topics:
- File parsing (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
- Working with APIs (requests, pagination, authentication)
- Data transformations with Pandas & SQLAlchemy
- Logging, error handling, and config-driven ETL design
- Data validation (Great Expectations-style)
- Connecting Python with Airflow, AWS, and databases

### Outcome:
You’ll build **modular, fault-tolerant ETL jobs** in Python that integrate smoothly with orchestration systems and data warehouses.

---

## 🧮 3. SQL for Data Engineering (6-Week Plan, SQL Server Focus)

**Goal:** Move beyond CRUD into real analytical and pipeline SQL.

### Highlights:
- CTE pipelines and transaction-safe ETL  
- Advanced JOIN logic and CASE-based transformations  
- Window functions for analytical reporting  
- Dimensional modeling, star/snowflake schemas  
- MERGE-based incremental loads (SCD Type 2)  
- Query tuning, indexing, and optimization

### Theory Reinforcement:
- Query execution plans & cost-based optimization  
- OLTP vs OLAP schema design  
- Fact, Dimension, and Bridge table concepts  
- Normalization vs Denormalization trade-offs  

### Outcome:
You’ll be able to **design, populate, and optimize data warehouse models** with professional-level SQL.

---

## 🧱 4. Core Data Engineering Theory

**Goal:** Understand the architectural and systemic foundations of data engineering — the “why” behind every tool.

### Key Domains:

#### 🧩 Data Architecture & Design
- Data lifecycle (ingestion → processing → serving)
- ETL vs ELT, Lambda vs Kappa architectures
- Data Lake vs Warehouse vs Lakehouse

#### ⚙️ Data Modeling
- Dimensional modeling (Kimball)
- SCD Types (1–6)
- Data Vault, normalization, and schema evolution

#### ☁️ Cloud & Distributed Systems
- Partitioning, replication, and consistency models  
- Object storage design (S3, ADLS, GCS)
- Data pipeline deployment on AWS (Lambda, MWAA, Snowflake integration)

#### 🧠 Data Processing & Ingestion
- Batch vs streaming  
- CDC (Change Data Capture) concepts  
- Event-driven pipelines (Kafka/Kinesis fundamentals)

#### 🔐 Governance & Quality
- Data lineage, metadata management, and validation frameworks  
- Data privacy, RBAC, encryption, and compliance models

#### 🧰 Workflow & Versioning
- DataOps principles  
- Pipeline CI/CD  
- Testing and monitoring data reliability  

### Outcome:
Deep understanding of **how large-scale data systems are architected, governed, and optimized.**

---

## 🚀 5. Capstone Integration Plan

After completing the individual modules, the final step is an **end-to-end data pipeline project** combining all tools and concepts.

**Suggested Capstone:**
> *"Serverless Currency Exchange Rate ETL Pipeline"*

### Tools:
- Python Lambda for ingestion  
- S3 for data lake staging  
- Snowflake for warehouse  
- Airflow DAG for orchestration  
- SQL-based transformation with SCD logic  

### Goals:
- Automated ingestion from API  
- Incremental load logic (CDC/SCD2)  
- Scheduled pipeline orchestration  
- Monitoring & alerting integration

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

> “Data Engineering is not just about moving data.  
> It’s about **designing trust, scalability, and insight into every dataset**.”

This repo follows these principles:
- **Learn by doing** — every week ends in a small project.  
- **Understand the why** — every concept has a theory note.  
- **Build for production** — even exercises use real-world patterns.  

---

## 🧭 Future Additions

- Spark & PySpark for distributed transformations  
- Kafka for real-time pipelines  
- Data quality frameworks (Great Expectations, Soda)  
- Cloud-native DataOps deployment (Terraform + AWS + Snowflake)
